# Coding Rules

- Always research online to find documentation and best practices because these things change often and we want the most up-to-date information.
- Only work on one very specific item at a time that is defined within the project issue. Do not get sidetracked. Do not over-engineer.
- Always create a branch for an issue to work on it so we can isolate our work.
- Make commits often and make them very specific to certain things so it's easier to roll back.
